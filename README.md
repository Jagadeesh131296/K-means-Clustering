# K-Means Clustering

## ðŸ“Š Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of the **K-Means Clustering** algorithm, an unsupervised machine learning technique used to group similar data points into `K` clusters. It is commonly used for customer segmentation, pattern recognition, and image compression.

## ðŸ§  What is K-Means?

K-Means clustering aims to partition `n` observations into `K` clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean. The algorithm iteratively updates cluster centroids and reassigns points until convergence.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Automatic grouping of data into `K` clusters. The k value in our case here is 4.
- Visualization of clustered data (2D/3D plots)
- Scalable to large datasets
